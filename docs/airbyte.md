## Self-hosting the PlanetScale Airbyte Source Connector

1. [Self-publishing the docker image](#self-hosting-image)
2. [Add PlanetScale as a source in Airbyte](#planetscale-source)

<a name="self-hosting-image"></a>
### 1. Self-publishing the docker image

Run `make push REPO=<Your Dockerhub organization name>`

example : `make push REPO=phanatic`

When the command finishes, you should seen an output that shows your pointer to the docker image on Docker Hub.

Your image is now available at phanatic/airbyte-source:0.1.0
```

Full output
``` bash
 make push REPO=phanatic
